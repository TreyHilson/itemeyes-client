<p>
Version 1.0
Currently application is a tool for user to organize desired items and visualize their list digitally until they have the objects in the material world.
User can create items into database from front end with item name, info, price, and imageurl to embed image onto their list.
Future itirations would allow user to add a method to conctact the user.
This would be if the user is looking to buy or sell items listed.

</p>

# Concept:
<p>
My goal was a minimum viable product (MVP) that could be built upon for a variation of uses in the future.
Application where users can add desired items to list to visualize their goals and budget.
This could be fun for niche things or items of rarity that donâ€™t normally come up in the regular listings. App will utilize react.js and ability to insert image url.
